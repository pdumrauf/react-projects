# Project Description

Create an application to search for movies.

## API to Use

- [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)  
  Obtain the API Key by registering your email on the website.

## Requirements

✅ Display an input field to search for movies and a button to initiate the search.  
✅ List movies with their title, year, and poster.  
✅ Ensure the form is functional.  
✅ Display movies in a responsive grid layout.  
✅ Implement data fetching from the API.

### First Iteration:

✅ Prevent duplicate searches for the same query.  
✅ Automatically trigger the search as the user types.  
✅ Avoid continuous API calls while typing (debounce implementation).
